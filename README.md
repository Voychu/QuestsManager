# QuestManager
A training project made during an internship in Aibron. It has back-end functionality for task management. 
You can register, add quests and assign them to bigger projects and add SMS-reminders. It uses Java Spring Boot, Spring Security and Twilio API. 
Right now the spring security authentication is based on MySQL database credentials. The plan is to further update the security with jwt authorization.

#TODO
Add WebSocket's to either add quests or audio recordings
Add JWT to authorize user
